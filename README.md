This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked Firebase issue concerning data persistence.  The problem arises from inconsistent use of database references when `setPersistence(LOCAL)` is enabled.  The `inconsistentRefBug.js` file illustrates the incorrect usage leading to data loss across sessions. The `inconsistentRefSolution.js` file provides the corrected implementation ensuring data is persisted consistently.
