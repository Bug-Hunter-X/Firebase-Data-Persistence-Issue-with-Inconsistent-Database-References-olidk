In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't persisting across sessions even though I was using the `setPersistence(LOCAL)` method.  After careful debugging, I discovered that the problem stemmed from inconsistent use of database references.  In one part of the application, I was using a reference obtained through `firebase.database().ref()` whereas elsewhere I was using a reference created directly from the root path: `firebase.database().ref('/myData')`.  This inconsistency, even with persistence enabled, caused data written through one type of reference to not be loaded by the other, leading to data loss across sessions.
